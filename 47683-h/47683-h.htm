<h1 id='t56'>PUBLISHER’S NOTE</h1>

<p class='pindent'>This little story, by Miss Marshall Saunders,
author of “Beautiful Joe,” appeared some years
ago in England, in the interests of a benevolent
institution. It has seemed worthy of a
wider publication, and hence it is brought out
in its present dress. The infantile grace and
quaint ways of the little child; her influence in
shaping a somewhat warped life, with all its
incidental lessons, and the final happy ending of
it all, will give the little story, we are sure, a
wide audience and a cordial reception.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>O</span>NE evening, Mrs. Drummond,
  the tired, careworn woman who
presided over our boarding house,
glanced down the well-spread table, and informed
us that the next day we were to
have a new boarder—a Mr. Robertson,
a young bank clerk who had lately come
from England to our prosperous Canadian
town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew the lad by reputation, and the next
morning when he sauntered into the dining room,
I looked at him carefully. Poor boy, his eye
was heavy, and his step languid. In his foolish
endeavors to “see life,” he was fast losing the
purity of heart and mind with which he had quitted
his far-away home, and it was making its mark
upon him in a way not to be mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat opposite me, and I could see that
he was making a mere pretence of taking his
breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, there was a remark from Mrs.
Drummond’s end of the table. The child was
speaking—the child par excellence, for there was
not another one in the house. She was a curious
little creature—willful, disdainful, neglected by
her mother, and suspicious of all other mortals.
Petting she despised, and invariably showed symptoms
of displeasure if disturbed in her favorite
occupation of playing with an ugly, yellow cat in
dark corners of the house. But the strangest
thing of all was her quietness. She never
romped like other children, never prattled; indeed,
she rarely spoke at all, so we were all attention
as she pointed to young Robertson with her
spoon, and said in a clear, babyish voice, “Dat’s
a berry fine-lookin’ boy, mamma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody smiled, for the boy in question,
though manly and stalwart in appearance, had a
decidedly plain face. He blushed a little, and
bent over his plate. Mrs. Drummond took her
hand from the coffee-urn long enough to lay it
on Daisy’s head: “Hush, child, you must not
talk at the table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wemove dat hand,” said the child, in a
displeased tone. Then rapping on the table with
her spoon, to call Robertson’s attention, she asked,
“Boy, what’s your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland Robertson,” he replied, with an embarrassed
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy, intensely interested, and altogether regardless
of the boarders’ amused glances, said in
a stage whisper, while she solemnly wagged her
curly head, “Woland Wobertson, I love you.”
Then scrambling out of her high-chair, she ran
down the long room, and peremptorily demanded
a seat on his knee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started, looked annoyed, then sheepish,
and finally took her up. It did not suit his
English reserve to be made the cynosure of all
eyes. Daisy sedately arranged her flounces,
then watched him playing with his food. “Don’t
you like fwicasseed chicken?” she asked, gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said; “but I am not hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some mornin’s I eat nuffin too,” she said,
in a relieved way; “more partickler when I have
a glass of milk in de night. Woland,” tenderly
patting the hand around her waist, “did you have
a dwink in de night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robertson’s face became scarlet. She viewed
him with the utmost solicitude. Then turning to
a lady next her, who had finished her breakfast,
and was indolently fanning herself, “Dive me dat
fan, de poor darlin’ is hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both on that occasion and many subsequent
ones, Daisy amused us by the epithets she bestowed
upon her favorite. We found that she
had not been an inattentive observer of the many
newly married couples that had sojourned at
Mrs. Drummond’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robertson was fanned for several
minutes—Daisy striking his face,
with an extra now and then for his nose, in her
awkward zeal, until I wondered at his patience.
Suddenly, he pushed back his chair, said he had
finished his breakfast and that she had better get
down. This gave rise to a stroke of childish
policy. She ordered the table-maid to bring her
hitherto neglected plate of porridge, and putting
the spoon in Robertson’s hand insisted upon his
feeding her. He complied with a pretty good
grace. Daisy kept up an unbroken scrutiny of
his face, and presently dodging a spoonful of milk,
laid a pink forefinger on his upper lip. There
was just the faintest suspicion of a moustache
there. “I fordet what you call dis,” she said,
“moss—moss——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moustache,” he replied, abruptly bringing
the porridge feeding performance to a close, and
putting her on her tiny feet. She ran out of
the room after him, pulling the napkin from her
neck as she went. When I reached the hall,
Robertson was taking down his hat from the rack,
Daisy in close attendance. She was just prefacing
a remark with, “Woland, love,” when Mrs.
Drummond came out of the dining room.—“Daisy,”
she said, peevishly, “you must say Mr. Robertson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How berry cross you are dis mornin’,” said
the child, throwing a glance at her over her
shoulder; then turning to Robertson, she went on
to ask him whether he would soon come back, to
see her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he replied, his hand on the door, “I
lunch in town; you won’t see me till evening.”
The child’s face fell, and she turned silently away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went out quickly, and overtook him before he
reached the corner of the street. “That child
seems to have taken quite a fancy to you,” I said
quietly; “I never before knew her to show so much
interest in any one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know why she does,” he answered
awkwardly, and with some impatience, “unless it is
owing to my having spoken to her the other day.
When I went to engage my room, she was sitting
in a corner alone, and I gave her a picture I
happened to have in my pocket.” He stopped
suddenly. He did not tell me then, nor did I
find out until long afterward, that the little, lonely
child had reminded him of a dead sister of his,
and that when he gave her the picture, he gave
her a kiss with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made some trite remark about the softening
and good influences a child can throw around
one—I did not intend to hint at all that he was
in need of such influences; but so suspicious was
he in his dawning manhood, that he resented my
remark, and relapsed into profound silence. A
minute later, he left me, under the pretence of
taking a short cut to the bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not see him again until evening. I
entered the dining room on the first stroke of the
dinner bell. Mrs. Drummond had just preceded
me. I could not help smiling at her dismayed
face. Daisy, with excited, nervous movements,
was dragging her high-chair from the head of the
table, to a place near Robertson’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That young man has bewitched the child,”
she said fretfully. “She slapped me just now,
because I would not let her put on her best dress
for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she was speaking Robertson entered the
room. He was in better spirits than in the
morning. When his eye fell on Daisy, sitting
flushed with victory beside his plate, he smiled and
pinched her cheek as he sat down. During the
progress of the meal he showed a certain amount
of attention to the scrap of humanity at his side;
and she, with no eyes for the other people at
the table, hung on his looks, and with a more
practical interest in his welfare, watched every
morsel of food that went into his mouth. Once
she said impatiently to me, “You wed-haired man,
you—don’t you see dat Woland wants some vegetables?
Pass some quick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner over, all scattered about the house.
Daisy never retired earlier than any other person,
so I watched her curiously to see what she
would do. Robertson had gone to his room.
With a disappointed air she seated herself on the
lowest step of the staircase. Some young men
standing about the hall tried to tease her.
“Baby dear,” said one of them mischievously,
“I’m afraid you’re going to be a flirt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s dat?” she said, holding out inviting
arms to the yellow cat that was sneaking about
my boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A flirt is an animal with eyes all over its
head, and an enormous mouth, and it goes about
the world eating men,” explained another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Daisy—she was yet at the stage of
believing everything she heard. She shrugged
her white shoulders, as she said, “Drefful!” and
hugged her dingy cat a little closer. Presently
they all laughed. She had thrown the cat to
the floor, and sprung to her feet. Robertson
was coming downstairs, very carefully dressed, a
light overcoat thrown over his arm. Evidently,
it was his intention to spend the evening with
some of his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy inquired wistfully whether he was going
out, and on his replying in the affirmative, she
asked whether it was “work” that was taking
him—that term signifying to her something that
could not be neglected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Daisy,” he said, trying to escape her
detaining hands, “I am going to see a play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woland,” she said beseechingly, “won’t you
stay an’ play wid me an’ Pompey?” pointing toward
the yellow cat, that was glaring at him from under
a hall chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a very inviting prospect. He
laughed, put her aside, saying, “Some other
time, little girl,” and went toward the hall door.
The child watched him, her little breast heaving,
her hands clenched tightly in the folds of her
dress. He was going to leave her, the only
person in the house whom she cared for. The
disappointment was too great, “Oh, Woland—I
fought you would stay,” she said, in a choking
voice. Then dropping on the white fur rug at
her feet, she burst into a perfect passion of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was such an unprecedented proceeding
on the part of the self-contained child, that a
crowd of anxious faces soon surrounded her.
“Whatever is the matter with the child?” said
her mother querulously, as she bent over the pink,
sobbing bundle. “She hasn’t cried since the
day she fell downstairs, and nearly killed herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robertson hurried back at the sound of the
wailing voice. “Has she hurt herself?” he asked
anxiously. He looked astonished when we explained
the cause of her emotion. “Don’t cry,
Daisy,” he said, “I will stay with you to-morrow
evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child’s sobs redoubled. He hesitated,
looked at his watch, then muttered “I suppose I
would be a brute to leave her like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daisy,” I whispered in her curly locks, “he
is going to stay with you.” A shriek of joy,
and the child was on her feet, clinging to his
hand with an enthusiasm that made him turn
away with a half-foolish air. The next two
hours were uninterrupted bliss for Daisy. She
spent them in one of the parlors, leaning against
Robertson’s knee, looking at photographs of the
Athenian Marbles. They were evidently Greek
to her, but one glance at Robertson would smooth
out her little, puzzled forehead. At ten o’clock
her little head drooped and she soon fell fast
asleep, so that he carried her upstairs, her face
bordered by its curls resting confidingly on his
shoulder. When he came down, I saw him
glance irresolutely at the clock, as if uncertain
whether to go out or not. I asked him whether
he would like to come to my room. I had some
curios which I had picked up in my rambles
about the world which I thought would be of
interest to him. Some of them I told him were
from Athens, and bore some relation to the Marbles
he had been examining. He thanked me
very politely, but very stiffly, and said that at some
future time he would like to see them. In
some way, he hardly knew why, he felt very
sleepy this evening, and would go to bed at once.
He went, and thoughts of his little companion
went with him as he sunk to a rest purer and
sweeter than that which had been his during the
weeks preceding.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HE next day was Sunday. As
  I came downstairs in the morning
I saw that Daisy was in her old place, on
the lowest step of the staircase. My salutation
she returned with reserve, but presently I heard
a gay, “Mornin’, dear,” and turning around, saw
that she was holding up her face to Robertson
for a kiss. Before they entered the dining room,
she made solicitous inquiries about his night’s rest.
He laughed shortly. “I haven’t slept so well
for many a night,” he said. Her little face
brightened, and they went together to the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The church bells were ringing when we finished
breakfast, and some one laughingly asked Daisy
where she was going to attend service. “You
are teasin’ me,” she said rebukingly; “you know
I berry seldom go out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does no one take you for walks?” asked
Robertson. The child shook her head, and said
that her mamma was always busy. The lad
drew up his stalwart frame, stifled some kind of
an indignant exclamation, and looked pityingly
down at the pale, delicate figure of the child.
Daisy was watching him attentively. “Woland,”
she said inquiringly, “Have you any work dis
mornin’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Daisy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then can’t you dive me a walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her little hand stole confidingly in his. Her
tone was coaxing in the extreme. He laughed,
and said: “Very well—go ask your mamma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In delighted surprise, she scampered to her
mother’s end of the table. “Mamma, may I go
a-walkin’ wid Wo—wid Mithter Wobertson?”
Mrs. Drummond looked up, hastily ran her eyes
over Daisy’s shabby frock, then over Robertson’s
handsome suit of clothes. “You have nothing
fit to wear, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy’s face became the picture of despair.
“The child looks very well as she is,” interposed
Robertson dryly, as he walked toward them, “and
it is a warm day; she only wants a bonnet.”
Daisy listened in delight, then when her mother’s
consent was gained, seized Robertson’s fingers
and pressed them to her lips. Not long after I
had taken my seat in church that morning, a tall
young man with
a child clinging to
him, came walking
up the aisle
to a seat in front
of me. To my surprise, I saw
Robertson and Daisy. He, I fear,
napped a little during the sermon. Not a
word was lost on Daisy. She sat bolt upright,
her hands clasped in front of her, her eyes fixed
on the clergyman. At the close of the service,
we found ourselves near each other and walked
home together. As we passed through the hot,
sunny streets, Robertson, as if to apologize for
being in church, said, “After we got outdoors
this morning, Daisy insisted upon going to church,
to see the clergyman ‘wing de bells.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The child is almost a heathen,” I answered,
in a low voice; “I wish her mother would send
her to Sunday-school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy’s sharp ears caught my remark. “Is
dat where little chillens go Sunday afternoons,
wid pretty books under dere arms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I replied; “wouldn’t you like to go
too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I, Woland?” eagerly. “I will be
berry good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, and said that they must ask her
mamma to give the subject her consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest of the day, Daisy followed
Robertson about the house like a pet dog.
Toward evening, some of his friends came in,
and he shook himself free from her, and went up
to his room with them. After a time, they all
came trooping downstairs. The sound of their
merry voices floated to the room where I was
sitting. But they were all hushed, when a babyish
voice asked, “Are you going out, Woland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robertson resorted to artifice to prevent the
recurrence of a scene. “Daisy,” he said, “my
friend here, Mr. Danforth”—laying his hand on
the shoulder of the youth nearest him—“is a great
admirer of yellow cats. Do you suppose that
Pompey could be persuaded to walk upstairs and
say ‘How-do-you-do’ to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, dear boy,” said the child, trotting
downstairs to fulfill her favorite’s behest. When
the sound of her footsteps died away, there was
subdued laughter, and some one said, “Who is
that pretty child, Robertson?” Then the door
banged, and there was silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I heard Daisy returning, I went to the
door. She came hurrying along, firmly holding
the disconsolate-looking, yellow animal under her
arm. A blank look overspread her face when
she saw that I was sole occupant of the hall.
“Where is Mithter Wobertson?” she inquired
of me in a dignified way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has gone out,” I said, as gently as I
could. “Won’t you come and talk to me for a
little while?” Disregarding the latter part of
my sentence, she said mournfully, “Do you weally
fink so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I nodded my head. She let the cat slip to
the floor, with a wrathful “Get downstairs, you
wetched beast,” and then went silently away.
There was a little, dark corner near a back staircase,
to which she often retreated in times of
great trouble. There I think, she passed the
next hour. About nine o’clock she appeared and
from that time until nearly every one in the house
had gone to bed, she wandered restlessly, but
quietly, about the parlors and halls. I knew
what she was waiting for—poor, little, lonely
creature. Shortly after eleven, Mrs. Drummond
put her head in the room. “Why, Daisy,” fretfully,
“aren’t you in bed yet? Go right upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child silently obeyed, refusing, by a disdainful
gesture, my offer to carry her. That
night I could not get to sleep. It seemed as if
I too was listening for a returning footstep. About
one o’clock, there was a sound on the staircase.
I got up, opened my door, and seeing that the
night-light was burning in the hall, stepped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robertson, with his hand on the railing, and
a terribly red face, was coming slowly upstairs.
Just as he reached his door, a little, white-robed
figure stole into the hall. She ran up to him.
“Oh my darlin’, darlin’ boy,” with a curious catching
of her breath, “I fought you was lost, like de
Babes in de Wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He steadied himself against the wall, only
half comprehending what she said. Then he
muttered thickly, “Go to bed, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vewy well,” she murmured obediently, then
standing on tip-toe, “Kiss me good-night, Woland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With abashed eyes and shamed countenance,
the young man looked down at the innocent, baby
face, shining out of its tangle of curls. He was
not fit to kiss her and he knew it. He turned
his head from her, and in tones harsher than he
really meant said, “Go away, Daisy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child still clung to him. She did not
understand why the caress should be denied her.
Suddenly his mood changed. He uttered an
oath, pushed her violently from him, and staggered
into his room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child fell, struck her head heavily against
the floor, then lay quite white and still. I hastened
toward her, took her up in my arms, and
rapped at her mother’s door. Mrs. Drummond
was still up, sitting before a table, making entries
in an account book. She started in nervous
surprise, then when I explained matters, looked
toward the empty crib, and said, “She must have
slipped by me when my back was turned. Has
she fainted? She sometimes does. I don’t
know why she should be such a delicate child.
Please put her in the crib. I will get some
brandy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I glanced uneasily at the child’s pale face, then
quitted the room. Early the next morning, Mrs.
Drummond knocked at my door. “I wish you
would come and look at Daisy,” she said querulously;
“she has not slept all night, and now she
has fallen into a kind of stupor; I can’t get her
to speak to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hurried to the child’s cot, and bending over
it said, “Daisy, don’t you want some breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She neither moved nor spoke, and after making
other ineffectual attempts to rouse her, I said,
“The child is ill—you must call a doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we get Mr. Robertson to speak to
her,” she replied. “This may be only temper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On going to his room I shook him vigorously.
“Robertson, Robertson, wake up.” After some
difficulty, I roused him. He shuffled off the bed
as I told him my errand, and in a moment we
were beside the sick child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak to her,” said Mrs. Drummond impatiently;
“she is ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brushed his hand over his face, and leaning
over her said, “Daisy, won’t you speak to
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of his voice, the child opened
her eyes, and looked up at him dreamily. Then
in a low voice, she repeated the terrible oath he
had uttered a few hours before. It sounded
unspeakably dreadful coming from her childish lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put on your coat,” I said, “and go for a
doctor; the child’s mind is wandering.”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HAT was the beginning of troublous times.
  For that day, and many subsequent days,
the angel of death hovered over the child. A
fever had seized upon her, and her little body became
wasted and spent till she was but a shadow
of her former self. In her delirium, Robertson’s
name was constantly on her lips. He, poor
fellow, could do nothing. From the first day a
nurse was installed in the sick-room, and no one
was allowed to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on that day that I met, on my way
to my office, one of Robertson’s superiors in the
bank. “By the way,” he said, “one of our
clerks boards where you do—Roland Robertson,
his name is. Do you know anything about
him? Can you tell me anything in regard to
his habits?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very little,” I said hesitatingly. I knew
that the man before me was a model of all virtues,
and had very little patience with youthful follies.
He spoke a few words in a disparaging way,
and I knew that Robertson’s careless habits were
drawing suspicion upon him, and endangering the
remarkably good position he held. The thought
flashed into my mind, that perhaps it would be
as well for little Daisy to die. The shock of
having been the indirect means of her death
would sober the lad her little lonely heart had
clung to, and make a man of him for life. God
was going to take her from us. I pitied Robertson
from the bottom of my heart. He was
going about the house with a set face which assured
me that he had not the slightest hope of
the child’s recovery. He never spoke to any
one, and after the bank closed, came home and
shut himself up in his room. How he passed
the time no one knew. One night, I heard
Mrs. Drummond come to his door, knock gently,
and ask whether he would like to come and say
good-bye to Daisy. The doctor had said that she
would probably not live through the night, and the
nurse thought that now she was having the lucid
interval which sometimes comes before death—and
she wanted to see him. I stole quietly out of
my room, Robertson stood in the hall, his hand
on the door-handle, an expression of terrible anguish
on his face. Suddenly he composed his
features, and went toward the child’s room. I
paused on the threshold. The room was
dimly lighted
and as quiet as
the grave. Between the windows,
on her mother’s
large bed, the
child lay—a little, frail, white
ghost, her skin deathly pale,
and drawn very tightly over her
bones, her beautiful, dark eyes
fixed languidly on Robertson.
He stood at the foot of the bed,
his hands clasped around the iron
bars with a kind of stony composure
on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daisy gave him a little, wistful
smile. Her affection for him was as strong
as ever. The fever had not burnt it up, nor
was it killed by the pains that racked her tender
body. Presently, she murmured a request that
he would come beside her. The nurse made
room for him by the pillow. He knelt down,
clenching one hand in the white counterpane with
a vice-like grasp, and holding gently in the other
the wasted fingers that Daisy stole feebly toward
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woland, dear boy,” she murmured, in a
scarcely audible voice, “I’ve been werry ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His forehead contracted a little. “Yes, I
know,” and his voice was very soft and tender
and had the sound of tears in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m better now. Mebbe I’ll get up
in de mornin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her. For one instant the rigid
control in which he held himself almost gave way.
But he recovered himself and she went on feebly:
“Will you carry me down to breakfus’?” Then
her eyes closed. She seemed to be slipping
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face became like marble. The child
was dying, and she did not know it. He put
his lips to her ear: “Daisy,” in an agonized voice,
“this is a sad world; wouldn’t you like to go
and leave it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child lifted her heavy lids. “Leave it,”
she lisped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and go to heaven,” he ejaculated in
a desperate, broken voice. “where the Lord Jesus
our Savour is. You will be very happy there.
He will give you a white robe and a golden
harp, and you will have other little children to
play with you; and there will be beautiful fields
and flowers—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How werry nice,” half sighed, half breathed
the exhausted child. A sweet, almost seraphic
smile, flitted over her little face. Then a doubt
assailed her. With a last, supreme effort, she
tried to raise herself and look in his face. “Are
you comin’ too, Woland?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A look of blank despair met her loving glance.
Surprised and bewildered, she shook off for an
instant her coming lethargy. “Woland,” she said
sharply, “I sha’n’t go to heaven widout you.”
Then she sank back on the pillow—her eyes
closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The frightful tension in which the lad held
himself gave way. Her little fingers slipped
from his grasp, and he fell back, in a dead faint.
It did not disturb the little one however, and in
a little time he was himself again, and anxiously
watching the coming of the end.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>F we poor, short-sighted mortals had the planning
  of our lives, how strangely would they
be laid out! I had imagined that the child was
going to die, in order that her influence over the
life that had become so strangely mixed up with
hers might live. It had not occurred to me
that the lad, thrown into a state of desperation
and feeling himself branded as her murderer,
might be tempted to some rash act. Thank
heaven, he was not put to it. The child did
not die, but lived to be a further blessing to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he waked from his swoon, we were
able to whisper in his ear that she had fallen
into a quiet sleep—that possibly there had been
a mistake made. He staggered to his feet,
and sat by the sleeping child for a while, with a
look of one who has received a reprieve from
death, then went to his room and shut himself
in. From that hour he was a different creature.
The heavy stamp of affliction had been
laid upon him. He was a man now, in the
best sense of the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day by day, Daisy steadily improved; Robertson
was constantly with her, and until she was
able to run about on her own small feet, he
carried her everywhere in his strong arms.
Sometimes he would walk up and down the
halls for hours at a time, listening to her childish
confidences and telling her stories with the utmost
patience and gentleness. And his devotion did
not cease when her strength returned. Her
solitary life was at an end. Half his leisure
time he spent with her. This had the inevitable
effect of lessening his intercourse with his former
boon companions. They had claimed a monopoly
of his time. Now he got in with another
set—these jolly, good fellows, who kept him out
in the daytime, playing out-door games, and
sending him home so exhausted that he wanted
no further excitement for the night, but a book,
a comfortable seat, and Daisy’s good-night kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The child was proving a guardian angel to
him, and not only to him, but to all the house.
An astonishing change had come over her since
her illness. She was always gentle now, never
sullen, and cheerful sometimes to gayety. The
boarders had all taken to petting her—she was a
link to bind them together and make them less
selfish—and she seemed to appreciate their attentions,
though her preference for Robertson was
decidedly marked. Even Mrs. Drummond was
changing. She often took Daisy on her lap
now, and I had seen her brush away a tear
when the child tried to smooth out her wrinkles
with her tiny hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the summer when Daisy recovered
from the fever. All through the autumn,
Robertson gave her walks and drives, bought her
picture-books and toys to amuse herself with
during his absence, and with a sense of gratitude
far beyond her years, her little heart seemed
running over with love toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the autumn closed my business connections
took me away, and for several years I
was a stranger to Fairfax. One winter day,
when the air was thick with snowflakes, I came
back. My first thoughts were of the Drummonds
and Roland Robertson. Strange to say,
he was one of the first men I met. He
knew me at once, gave me a hearty greeting,
and insisted upon my going along with him to
his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no need to ask him how he was
getting on. His surroundings showed worldly
prosperity, his face, the happy, upright man.
He looked grave when I spoke of the Drummonds.
“Poor Mrs. Drummond—she has been
dead for two years. She was utterly worn out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Daisy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stroked a heavy moustache. His object,
I think, was to conceal a smile. “She is in
England at school. Her holidays she spends
with my people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do they like her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Immensely. She has
grown to be a very beautiful
girl, both in disposition and looks.”
Then opening his coat, he drew from an
inner pocket a picture—the head of a lovely
young girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I scarcely recognized the delicate child
of old. “And does she keep up her
devotion to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She does.” He gave me a decidedly
amused glance; carefully replaced
next the photograph two or three pressed
white field daisies that had fallen out, and
put it back in his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is to become of her?” I went
on curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked about his handsome, but solitary
drawing room. “I am going to England in the
spring, to get her,” he said with a laugh. “I
have tried living without her, and I can endure it
no longer.”</p>
